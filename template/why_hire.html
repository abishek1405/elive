          Exceptional independent college counselors strategically position
          students for admission to their dream universities. From the moment a
          student begins working with them, these counselors craft a
          personalized roadmap for the high school journey (or the remaining
          years of it). This includes selecting the most challenging courses,
          preparing for the right standardized tests, pursuing standout
          extracurriculars, building strong relationships for compelling letters
          of recommendation, showing demonstrated interest to target colleges,
          and much more.
        </p>
        <p class="para content-para">
          Perhaps most importantly, top-tier college counselors help reduce the
          tension and pressure that often arise within families during the
          admissions process. Say goodbye to slammed doors and heated dinner
          table debates over essay topics—professional guidance brings clarity
          and calm.

        <p class="para content-para">
          But in our experience, most students grow to love the best college
          they're accepted into. That's why our primary focus is helping them
          gain admission to the most prestigious institutions their profiles can
          realistically support.

          It's not that counselors who prioritize “fit” aren't effective—it's
          just that we see it as a softer approach. At Elite Ivy , our mission
          is clear: to help students get into their dream schools. Families who
          work with us can count on that goal being front and center in
          everything we do.

            INDEPENDENT COLLEGE COUNSELORS VS. HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS

          Not long ago, research showed that each public high school counselor
          was, on average, tasked with guiding nearly 300 students. Even in
          smaller schools, the ratio can be daunting. While many of these
          counselors care deeply about their students, the sheer volume of their
          workload—much of which has little to do with college admissions—makes
          it difficult for them to provide expert guidance on getting into
          top-tier universities.
        </p>
        <p class="para content-para">
          And the picture isn't necessarily brighter at the country's top
          private schools. Even when the ratios are more favorable, counselors
          at elite prep schools often have their own biases. Some play
          favorites, advocating more strongly for students whose families are
          closely tied to the institution. Others may discourage students from
          applying to certain colleges, not because the students aren't
          qualified, but to limit internal competition among applicants.
        </p>
        <p class="para content-para">
          Moreover, even at these prestigious schools, counselors rarely have
          the bandwidth to help students build unique extracurricular profiles
          that captivate admissions officers—or to revise multiple drafts of
          personal statements until they truly shine.

            THE RISE OF PRIVATE COLLEGE COUNSELORS

          This is where private college counselors come in. A national survey
          conducted in 2013 found that about 26% of high-achieving high school
          students sought the guidance of private admissions consultants. In our
          view, that number likely falls short of reality—many students simply
          prefer not to admit they had help navigating the highly competitive
          college admissions process.
        </p>
        <p class="para content-para">
          At Elite Ivy, we like to joke that we often end up working with
          siblings, frequently with cousins, but almost never with friends. Why?
          Because parents often prefer to share that their child got into a top
          university entirely on their own—and that's completely okay with us.
          Still, if over a quarter of high-performing students admitted to using
          private counseling services back in 2013, imagine how much that number
          has grown since.
